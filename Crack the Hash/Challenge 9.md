This is bcrypt. Bcrypt is comprimsed of the blowfish cipher, a randomized salt, and a cost factor. On top of that the 
creation of this hash is costly to GPUs due to it's slow creation time, an intentional feature making preprocessing of changing keys taxing for crackers.

Wordlists alone won't help. I would recommend a wordlist + rule OR incremental brute forcing. Using incremental mode will help reduce
cracking time without having to guess the number of characters.
