Create a seasonal wordlist; for example, a text file with each string on it's own line: summer, Summer, winter, Winter, spring, Spring.

Create a rule in hashcat/rules/ called seasons.rule so you can append strings like 2024, 2024!, 2025, 2025! by 
pasting below in your .rule file, each string in it's own line. This combination will create passwords like winter2020!.
