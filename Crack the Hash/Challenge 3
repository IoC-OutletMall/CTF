Rockyou won't suffice this round, try brute force instead. This password is exactly 12 characters and all lowercase. If using hashcat or John use a mask.

The mask in hashcat can still take a long time with weaker systems esepcially if you don't prevent duplicate characters. Use this custom mask to speed up the process: -1 glmou

This mask will be much more effiecient because the full lowercase alphabet for a 12 character password needs 95 quadrillion attempts whereas the 5 character mask, glmou, requires 244 million. With tesing repeat characters starting with 1, and then 2 it will require even less.
